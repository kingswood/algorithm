How to build a distributed hash.

determining whether an array has duplicate

Implement an insert method for a sorted circular linked list

what is the binary tree and balance binary tree as well as linked list, cyclic linked list

And how to find loop in a linked list

Given a string contain braces, ex String = "{{{}{}}{" return true or false depending if its a valid set/format meaning if there was code between the braces would it compile fine

Given 2 strings, determine if one is a rotation or roll of the other. Ex ( it returns true if the parameters are "HELLO" and "LLOHE"

Given an int, return the amount of '1' in the binary representation of it. Ex (17 -> 1001 => 2)
